<p>Traditional company</p>
<p>The classic structure of such companies consists of several departments that operate separately. They&rsquo;re controlled by a head office that determines strategy and watches over its implementation. They havge a system of command and control and everybody knows his place, therefore the corporate hierarchy has formed.</p>
<p>New trends</p>
<p>For example, large-scale shift of responsibility to outsiders for what were once considered a company&rsquo;s core of functions &ndash;via outsourcing, joint-ventures and other sorts of alliances.
And &ldquo;networked person&rdquo;, a species that is always on the move, juggling with a laptop computer, a mobile phone and a tablet, keeping in electronic touch with people he no longer regularly bumps into in a corridor. Indeed, there may be no corridor.</p>
<p>Long-distance meetings can avoid expensive airfares for international companies.</p>
<p>But face-to-face ones are more valuable for small companies, even if they stretch managers&rsquo; time and put demand on limited cash flows.</p>
<p>At large companies, face-to-face interactions between low-level marketing staff just aren&rsquo;t necessary, but interactions between business units with similar or overlapping objectives are important, no matter the size of the company.</p>
<p>That said, a well-prepared meeting with a set agenda, and an effective facilitator can make it work either way.</p>
<p>slang:
bend over backwards:
try very hard to please someone or do something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll help you a bit, but don&rsquo;t expect me to bend over backwards</p>
<p>lay it on the line:
be very direct or frank</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t bear George any more &ndash; he doesn&rsquo;t do half as much work as the others. So I called him in and laid it on the line &ndash; either he starts doing his work like anybody else or we fire him at the end of the month.</p>
